# LinkedList-DSA

# LinkedList Class

This JavaScript class defines a singly linked list and provides various methods to manipulate the list. A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure used in computer science for various applications.

## Class Methods

### `push(value)`

Appends a new node with the given value to the end of the linked list.

### `pop()`

Removes and returns the last node from the linked list.

### `unshift(value)`

Prepends a new node with the given value to the beginning of the linked list.

### `shift()`

Removes and returns the first node from the linked list.

### `get(index)`

Retrieves and returns the node at the specified index.

### `set(index, value)`

Updates the value of the node at the specified index.

### `insert(index, value)`

Inserts a new node with the given value at the specified index in the linked list.

### `remove(index)`

Removes and returns the node at the specified index.

### `reverse()`

Reverses the order of nodes in the linked list.

## Class Structure

### `Node`

- Represents a node in the linked list.
- Contains a `value` property to store the node's value and a `next` property to reference the next node in the list.

### `LinkedList`

- Represents the singly linked list.
- Contains a `head` property, which points to the first node in the list, a `tail` property, which points to the last node in the list, and a `length` property to keep track of the number of nodes in the list.

Feel free to use this class in your JavaScript projects for various data manipulation tasks.
